# Getting Started with Create React App

        This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About:

        The reason I did this project is because I love Chevrolet trucks and I've owned all different kinds and sizes throughout the years. Lifted trucks are very fun to drive, I owned one that had a nice lift on it with big tires that was 4 x 4(4 wheel drive). Anyway, on this Blog site, `Lifted Truck Blog`, you can register, login, logout, create a new blog, edit that particular blog, and delete that same blog as well. I used React.js for this project. I'm very happy with the results. It's nice to learn the platform that Facebook & Netflix are built on(React.js).

## Libraries Used for this project

        Bootstrap, Browser-router from React, Use-State from React, Use-Effect from React, and Toastify from React for error/success mesages. I used an NPM Install of -g concurrently(to run both front/back end together), nodemon, mongoose, express, express-validator, bcrypt.js, cors, and dotenv as an environment variable. I used axios to make the calls to the backend.

### `npm run dev`

After you globaly install "concurrently"(npm install -g concurrently), that will let you run the front end & the back end concurrently, in development mode, at the same time. Running the front end on port:3000 and the backend-server on port:8000.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.I did unit testing in the App folder under test. Unit testing applications are good practice and neccessary.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  I used React.js for this project and it turned out pretty good. I'm very happy with the results and it's nice to learn about the same platform that Facebook & Netflix are 
built on(React). I will be trying to use Remix in the future for other React projects after I finish my Texas Hockey React.js webpage. Looking forward to graduating and getting my Full-stack certificate after this project.
