# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the front end and the back end, concurrently, in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode for Unit Testing.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  The reason I did this project is because I love Chevrolet trucks and I've owned all different kinds and sizes throughout the years. Lifted trucks are very fun to drive, I 
owned one that had a nicelift on it. Anyway, on this Blog site, `Lifted Truck Blog`, you can register, login, logout, create a new blog, edit that particular blog, and delete that 
same blog as well.
  
  I used React.js for this project and it turned out pretty good. I'm very happy with the results and it's nice to learn about the same platform that Facebook & Netflix are built 
  on(React). Looking forward to graduating and getting my Full-stack certificate.
  
## Libraries Used for this project
  Bootstrap, Browser-router from React, Use-State from React, Use-Effect from React, and Toastify from React for error/success mesages. I used, nodemon, mongoose, express, 
  express-validator, bcrypt.js, cors, and dotenv as an environment variable. I used axios to make the calls to the backend.
