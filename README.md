# Getting Started with Create React App

        This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About:

        The reason I did this project is because I love Chevrolet trucks and I've owned all different kinds and

sizes throughout the years. Lifted trucks are very fun to drive, I owned one that had a nicelift on it with big tires 4 x 4. Anyway, on this Blog site, `Lifted Truck Blog`, you can register, login, logout, create a new blog, edit that particular blog, and delete that
same blog as well.

        I used React.js for this project and it turned out pretty good. I'm very happy with the results and it's

nice to learn about the same platform that Facebook & Netflix are built on(React). Looking forward to graduating and getting my Full-stack certificate.

## Libraries Used for this project

        Bootstrap, Browser-router from React, Use-State from React, Use-Effect from React, and Toastify from React for error/success mesages. I used, nodemon, mongoose, express, express-validator, bcrypt.js, cors, and dotenv as an environment variable. I used axios to make the calls to the backend.

### `npm run dev`

Concurrently runs the app in development mode with the front end running on PORT:3000 and the backend running on PORT:8000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.I did unit testing in the App folder under test. Unit testing applications are good practice and neccessary.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
